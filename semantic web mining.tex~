\section{Introduction}
\begin {frame}[shrink]
\begin{itemize}
	\item The World Wide Web is today's largest warehouse of knowledge.
\item Documents over the Web is largely unorganized.
\item  Web is accessible only for humans.
\item Computers understand only the Web pages' structure and layout and have no
access to their intended meaning.
\item The Semantic Web aims to enrich the existing
Web with a layer of machine interpretable meta data so that a computer program
can draw conclusions.

\end{itemize}
 	\begin{block}{Semantic Web Mining}
  Web Mining applies data mining techniques to Web.  \alert { Semantic Web Mining} aims
at combining the two emergent research areas,  Semantic Web and Web Mining.

\section{Literature Survey}
\begin{frame}
\begin{block}{Tim Berners-Lee, 1999}
I have a dream for the Web in which computers become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web. The content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A 'Semantic Web', which should make this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines
\end{block}
\begin{itemize}
	 \item The increasing interest in Web
information retrieval led to the Semantic Web initiative from the World-Wide Web Consortium.
\item The Semantic Web is the  manifestation of graph
theory and description logic.

\end{itemize}

 \subsection{Research Scope}
\begin{frame}

 Web mining offers three areas 
 for  research 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Web usage mining : analyses the user behavior
         \item web structure mining: explores the hyper link structure
           \item Web content mining: exploits the contents of the documents in the web.
\end{itemize}      
   Among the three research areas, ontology approach is best suitable for Web content
mining . 
\begin{itemize}
	\item An ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization
.
\item In computer science, the word ontology, borrowed from philosophy, represents a set of
precisely defined terms (vocabulary) about a specific domain 
\item An ontology  enables people to agree upon the meaning of terms used in a 
domain.

\end{itemize}     
  \end{frame}
\section{Semantic Web Technologies: State of The Art }
\begin{frame}

 \begin{itemize}
 

  
\item Two aspects of Semantic Web programming:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Information Modeling 
\item  Application level integration
\end{enumerate}
  
\item   Information Modeling  can be broken into two subproblems:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Syntax sharing problem 
          \item Semantic sharing problem.
\end{enumerate}

\item Finding a common medium
for communication is analogous to the syntactic aspect of sharing data.


\item Finding a mutually intelligible encoding of concepts within the
common medium is analogous to the semantic data-sharing problem.
\item The combination of data and metadata solves  the information sharing
problem at the semantic level.

\end{itemize}
 \end{frame} 
\subsection{The Semantic Web Information Model : RDF}
\begin{frame}

 \begin{itemize}
\item Resource Description Framework is the data
model used by the Semantic Web
 \item In RDF, information is represented as a set of assertions called
statements made up of three parts: subject, predicate, and object (triples).
\item In RDF, resources can represent anything that can be named. A resource is,
in fact, nothing but a name that represents an object, act, or concept.
\item Resource names take the form of Internationalized Resource Identifiers.
  \end{itemize}

	\captionof{figure}{People as Resource }
	\label{fig:3.3}
\end{center}


 \end{frame}
\subsection{RDF Serializations}
\begin{frame}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{2-4.png}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
	\item RDF graphs are powerful tools for representing information, but they are
 good for human analysis unsuitable for application exchange.
\item Serialization makes RDF practical for information exchange by providing a
way to convert between the abstract model and a concrete format, such as
a file or other byte stream.
\item Three of the most popular RDF Serialization formats  are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  RDF/XML
\item Terse RDF Triple
Language (Turtle)
\item  N-Triples
\end{enumerate}


 \end{itemize}
                 
\end{frame}


\subsection{Expressing Semantics in RDF}
\begin{frame}


\begin{itemize}
	\item To add meaning to RDF graphs,  needs
some means of defining a vocabulary of predefined terms with accompanying
semantics for describing the information.
\item The Semantic Web uses a combination of a schema language and an
ontology language to provide the capabilities of vocabularies, taxonomies, and
ontologies.
\item RDF Schema (RDFS) provides a specific vocabulary for RDF that
can be used to define taxonomies of classes and properties and simple domain
and range specifications for properties.
\item RDFS vocabularies describe the classes of resources and properties being
used in an RDF model.

 \end{itemize} 
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.30]{2-6.png}
\end{center}               
\end{frame}
\subsection{Ontology}
\begin{frame}


\begin{itemize}
	\item The term Ontology ( Greek words onto for existence,  and logos for science)

\item The key role that ontologies are likely to play in the future of the Web has led to the extension of Web markup languages.
\item  In the context of the Semantic Web, an ontology language should:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item be compatible with existing Web standards
\item define terms precisely and formally with adequate expressive power
\item be easy to understand and use
\item provide automated reasoning support 
\item provide richer service descriptions which could be interpreted by intelligent agents
\item be sharable across applications.


\end{enumerate}
\end {itemize}
                 
\end{frame}



\subsection{OWL}
\begin{frame}


\begin{itemize}
	\item W3C has designed the Web Ontology Language
\item  It is built on W3C standards RDF/RDFS  and extends these languages with richer modeling primitives.
\item  It is a revision of the DAML+OIL

\item OWL allows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the formalization of a domain by defining classes and properties of those classes, 
\item the definition of individuals and the assertion of properties about them, and 
\item the reasoning about these classes and individuals.
\end{itemize}
\item OWL, layered on top of RDFS, extends RDFS capabilities.
\item OWL adds various constructors for building complex class expressions, cardinality restrictions on properties, characteristics of properties and mapping between classes and individuals 
\item  An ontology in OWL is a set of axioms describing classes, properties and facts about individuals.



\end {itemize}
                 
\end{frame}

\subsection{Querying The Semantic Web}
\begin{frame}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Querying the Semantic Web requires a language that recognizes RDF 
\item  SPARQL is a recursive acronym for SPARQL Protocol
and RDF Query Language 
\item  An RDF data store is a special database system built for the
storage and retrieval of RDF statements.
\item 
A SPARQL endpoint can be understood as an interface that users (human or application)
can access to query an RDF data store by using SPARQL query language.
\item SPARQL provides four different forms of query:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item SELECT query
\item ASK query
\item DESCRIBE query
\item CONSTRUCT query

\end{enumerate}

\end {itemize}
                 
\end{frame}
\section{Research Aim and Objectives}
\begin{frame}


\begin{block}{Research Aim and Objectives}
	  Aim of this paper is to formulate an automated information retrieval
system prototype which provides semantic web visualization environment  as an interface and uses various
Semantic Web mechanisms in order to provide relevant information to end users or communities of
users. To achieve this goal, Web pages must be annotated, using the terms defined in an ontology.
Once the pages are semantically annotated, agents/applications  uses existing meta data and inference engines to
answer queries.
\end{block}

	\end{center}  

\end{frame}
\subsection{Architecture }
\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Starting from a textual search, the user is presented with a rich aggregate of information about the entity likely identified
with the query.
\item  Queries can be about people whose  FOAF Ontology based  annotation published  on the Semantic Web 
\item As the user visualizes the aggregate, he can follow links to other properties, switching the focus of visualization to that of neighboring entities.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Software Tools for Semantic Web Programming} 
\begin{frame}




Many tools and methodologies exist for the construction of ontologies. Some potential candidates are listed below.These tools may be divided into two groups
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Tools for which the knowledge model is directly formalized in an ontology language:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ontolingua Server
        \item OntoSaurus (Loom)
        \item OILed (OIL then DAML+OIL then OWL)
        \item Inference engines such as Fact and Racer
\end{itemize}
   \item Tools for which the knowledge model is independent from the ontology language:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Protege-OWL
        \item OntoEdit
        \item KAON
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}
\subsection{APIs for Semantic Web Programming} 
\begin{frame}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Jena is a programmer's API (application programming interface) for Java semantic
web applications. 
\item Primary use of Jena is to  write Java code that handles
RDF and OWL documents and descriptions.
\item  In Jena, a graph is called a model and is represented by the Model interface
\item The Named Graphs API for Jena (NG4J) is an extension to the Jena Semantic Web framework for parsing, manipulating and serializing sets of Named Graphs.
\item Sindice is a platform to build applications on top of named graphs . Sindice collects Web Data in many ways, following existing web standards, and offers Search and Querying across this data, updated live every few minutes.
\ite Sinice API consists of the following APIs
\begin{itemize}
	 
\item Sindice Search API
\item Sindice Cache API
\item Sindice Live API
\item Sindice Ping Submission API
\item Sigma API
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\subsection{SPARQL Engine } 
\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}

\item Joseki is a Web-based SPARQL endpoint.
\iten Joseki contains its own Web server, which hosts a Java servlet engine to support its SPARQL endpoint.
\item  It renders a Web query form so that user can enter the query manually, and by submitting the query form, it will return  the query result right away.
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.30]{jesoki1.png}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Prototype Design }
\begin{frame}

 To get an entity profile,  the user enters a textual query or inputs
URLs. The keyword and structured queries provided by the user form
the initial Query Plan. The Query Plan, is then passed along as in the following steps:


\begin{center}

	\captionof{figure}{Sigma Data Flow}
 \end {center}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Domain Ontology: FOAF}
\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
	\item FOAF stands for Friend of a Friend
         \item FOAF is  a vocabulary (or, ontology) which includes the
basic terms to describe personal information, such as who you are, what you do,
and who your friends are.
\item It serves as a standard for everyone who wants to mark
up their home pages and turn them into the documents that can be processed by
machines.
\end{itemize}

\section{Challenges and Obstacles}
\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This  work is designed to work on yet to emerge semantic web environment.
\item Most of the semantic web terminologies are in a premature stage and technologies
are yet to converge.
\item Most of the tools and APIs used are products of academic
research and difficult to integrate.
\item MVC architecture is not suitable for semantic web programming
\item In order to capture formal constraints, an additional constraint language  has to be used along with UML to incorporate semantic web concepts.
\item Technical issues such as scalability and usability.
\item Social issues (trust, privacy, etc.)
\item Economic issues (building a critical mass)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Semantic Web is big. It is fluid. It is dynamic and
evolving.
\item This paper summarizes the use of ontology in Web mining. 
\item  Through this work it is proved  that ontology was undoubtedly a key concept on Semantic Web and Semantic web mining  pathway.
\item The future Semantic Web development will depend on the progress of ontologies engineering.
\item Further investigating this interplay will give rise to new research
questions and stimulate further research both in the Semantic
Web and in Web Mining,towards the ultimate goal of
Semantic Web Mining: a better Web, for all of its users
